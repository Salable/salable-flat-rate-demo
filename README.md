![Salable Flat Rate Pricing Demo](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Salable/flat-rate-demo/f6053bdc6bb4a4be12a1dc07e805cf7a9854a91b/public/flat-rate-banner.gif)

This app demonstrates using [flat rate](https://www.salable.app/features/flat-rate-pricing) billing with Salable.

## Tech stack
- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/)
- [Vercel](https://vercel.com/docs)
- [Iron Session](https://github.com/vvo/iron-session)
- [Prisma (ORM)](https://www.prisma.io/)
- [Neon on Vercel (DB)](https://neon.tech/docs/guides/vercel-overview)


## Demo
[View demo](https://flat-rate-demo.vercel.app/)

The product in the demo generates strings with random data which vary in size
based on the number of bytes selected. To get access to the product a user must
sign up and subscribe to a plan. The byte sizes for the strings are feature
locked behind different plans. Once a user has subscribed they will be able to
access some or all of these features depending on what plan they are licensed
on.

The email of the sign-up does not have to be real, this is just for demo
purposes.

The demo is integrated with Stripe to handle payments which is running in test
mode so Stripe test cards can be used.

### Demo Card Details

**Card Number**: `4242 4242 4242 4242` \
**Expiry Date**: Any future date (`09/42`) \
**CVC**: Any 3-digit number (`123`) \
**Cardholder Name**: Anything (`Mr John Doe`)

## Auth

User details are stored in a postgres database using Neon with Vercel. Passwords are securely hashed
with unique salts. The ID of the logged-in user is used as the `granteeId` when
creating a license on Salable. It is also used for the license checks. If you're
developing an app within an existing ecosystem like Trello or Slack, you can
swap out the included authentication system with theirs.


### User sessions
[Iron Session](https://github.com/vvo/iron-session) is used for storing user session data.

## Project Setup

1. Clone the repo (`git clone git@github.com:Salable/salable-flat-rate-demo.git`)
2. Run `npm install`
3. Create an `.env` file (`cp .env.example .env`)
4. [Install Docker](https://www.docker.com/get-started/). If you already have Docker installed skip this step. If you don't want to run Docker for local development skip to the next stage for an alternative.
5. Run `docker compose up -d`
6. Run `npx prisma db push`

### Alternative to Docker
If you are using Docker skip to [Configure Salable](#configure-salable).

To remove the requirement of Docker we will change the db provider to `sqlite`.
1. Update the datasource in the `schema.prisma` file in the root of the project to use the provider `"sqlite"`
   ```
   datasource db {  
      provider = "sqlite"  
      url = env("DATABASE_URL")
   }
   ```
2. Update the `DATABASE_URL` var in your `.env` file to be `file:./dev.db`
3. Replace the contents of `./prisma/index.ts` with the code below -
   ```typescript
   import { PrismaClient } from "@prisma/client";
   import { PrismaLibSQL } from "@prisma/adapter-libsql";
   import { createClient } from "@libsql/client";
   import { env } from "@/app/environment";

   const libsql = createClient({ url: env.DATABASE_URL });
   const adapter = new PrismaLibSQL(libsql);
   export const prismaClient = new PrismaClient({ adapter });
   ```
4. Run `npx prisma db push`

### Configure Salable

1. [Sign up](https://salable.app/login) for Salable or [login](https://salable.app/login) if you already have an account.
2. Ensure you have `Test Mode` enabled.

#### Setup Product

1. Go to the Products page in the Salable dashboard and click the `Import product` button.
2. Navigate to this demo project in the file system on your machine. Select `salable-product.yaml` in the root of the project and import it.
3. As this is a paid product, you'll need to select a payment integration.
4. Click `Import file`.

### Update Environment Variables

1. Copy the Product ID from the `Overview` tab and assign to `NEXT_PUBLIC_PRODUCT_UUID` in the `.env` file.
2. Go to `Plans`. Assign the `Basic` ID to `NEXT_PUBLIC_SALABLE_PLAN_UUID` and the `Pro` ID to `NEXT_PUBLIC_SALABLE_PRO_PLAN_UUID`.
3. Go to `API Keys`.
4. Copy the API Key that was generated on sign up and assign to `SALABLE_API_KEY`.
5. Run `npm run dev`
